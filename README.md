# Precognition

![Screenshot](resources/textures/screenshot.png)

Precognition is a game submitted for the OLC CoderJam 2021, developed in C++ with the SFML library.
Unfortunately, I haven't much time to go to the whole hog (less than 2 days instead of 9), so the game 
is unfinished. So what you can see here is more of a game concept.

I was inspired by the game Galcon, where the player has to overwhelm the ennemy by conquering all
the planets of the galaxy. I wanted to made bases instead, where the enemies are aliens, with RPG
elements (random events, leveling etc...).

## Building

This project uses Git LFS to store large files (musics, textures...). So before cloning this repository,
install Git LFS to avoid any resources loading errors. 

You can build the project by creating a build directory and call cmake from there.
For example, in a terminal, to generate a Makefile for Linux, type : 'mkdir build && cmake ..'
